# socialmediaproject

This is a simple social network project for learning and practice purposes. It is not a complete project and is intended to be used as a starting point for experimentation and further development.

## Project Overview

The social network project consists of a Java application that simulates a social network. The application allows users to create profiles, connect with friends, post updates, and share media. The project includes the following main components:

- User class: Represents a user account and contains methods for managing the user's profile, friends, and posts.
- Post class: Represents a post and contains methods for creating and deleting posts.
- FriendRequest class: Represents a friend request and contains methods for managing friend requests.
- Message class: Represents a message and contains methods for sending and receiving messages.
- Encryption class: Provides methods for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.

The project uses the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API to integrate with a MySQL database, and includes the necessary SQL statements for creating the necessary tables in the database.
